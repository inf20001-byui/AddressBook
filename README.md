# Overview

This application was written as I learned about programming in C++.

This is a program in C++ that manages a simple address book. The address book consists of contacts which have the following information: first name, last name, phone number, email and notes. 

The program provides the following functionality:
- Creating a new contact and saving it to the address book
- Displaying all contacts stored in the address book
- Updating a contact stored in the address book
- Deleting a contact stroed in the address book

This program uses the iostream, fstream, and string libraries to handle input/output and file operations. The vector STL data structure library is used to store the contacts as strings, and the contact class is used to store and manipulate the contact information. The address book data is stored in a text file named "addressbook.txt".

# Future Work

Things that I would like to to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Develop a granular search feature
- Integrate into a web application for easy use
- Store data in a database
